         <h1>Moving beyond user-centredness</br>
           <small>From designing for users to designing with people</small>
         </h1>
         <div class="lead">
           <img src="img/users_not_customers.jpg" width="100%" alt="A sticker showing the word customers crossed with a read line, and the word users below it">
           <p class="after_image_paragraph">You might have seen this sticker around. It challenges the use of the word <strong>customer</strong> in the context of design, and advocates for the word <strong>user</strong> instead. </p>
           <h2>From <em>customers</em> to <em>users</em></h2>
           <p>What is not so widely known is that <strong>users</strong> are a relatively new thing. Back in the 1980s, there were no users: there were only <strong>customers</strong>.</p>
           <p>That was because there was no user research. All the research done in the context of product design was market research, which tries to answer the question: will customers buy this thing? And so we were all <strong>customers</strong> back then.</p>
           <p>But change was brewing. Universities saw the arrival of a new kind of academic, one that mixed computing with psychology and the social sciences. Their discipline was called Human-Computer Interaction. Around the same time, cutting edge design firms like IDEO started to hire psychologists and anthropologists to support their design processes.</p>
           <p>These people became the first user researchers, and user-centred design arrived with them. People at the receiving end of products and services stopped being customers and became <strong>users</strong>. These users were asked to participate in the design process mainly as <strong>test subjects</strong>, providing feedback through activities like usability studies.</p>
           <h2>From <em>users</em> to <em>people</em></h2>
           <p>This is where the bulk of our digital design world stands today. We design <strong>for our users</strong>, to whom we approach for information via interviews, or to ask them for feedback via usability testing sessions.</p>
           <p>This is all good stuff. It is much better to be a user than to be a customer. But while we are busy bringing user-centredness to our departments and projects, the world of design doesn’t stand still. </p>
           <p>Following on the path of some Scandinavian academics who wanted to democratise technology decision-making in the workplace, designers started to advocate a more active role for users. It should no longer be about designing for them: it should be about <strong>designing with them</strong>. This approach of going beyond user-centredness is often called <strong>participatory design</strong>.</p>
           <p>Participatory design recognises that <strong>users are an active part</strong> of technical systems and services. They are not just passive recipients of these systems and services: they actually shape them through the use they make of them. This active participation is often organic, unplanned and unconscious: users are not aware of it happening. </p>
           <p>Underpinning the participatory design philosophy is also the idea of <strong>users as experts</strong>. After all, nobody knows better than them about their goals, contexts and behaviours. We can harness this expertise to build better services, changing the organic, unconscious user participation into a more structured and aware one. </p>
           <p>But I should stop saying users now, because participatory design doesn’t like the word users much: they prefer participants, partners or simply <strong>people</strong>. </p>
           <p>As a user researcher and interaction designer building digital services, most of my work is still done in a user-centred, design-for-users sort of way. But I believe <strong>participatory design is what we should be aiming for</strong>. </p>

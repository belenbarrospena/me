         <h1>Belén Pena's curriculum vitae</h1>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>I have been a designer and researcher in the software industry since 2007. In 2017 I started
             <a href="https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.843744">my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction</a> at the School of Design of Northumbria University.
             My research explored how we can design fairer and more inclusive ﬁnancial technologies,
             in collaboration with people who have experienced mental illness and ﬁnancial diﬃculty. I was awarded a doctorate (without corrections) in September 2021.</p>
            <p>I am also an active contributor to the Free and Open Source Software community, and one
              of the founding members of <a href="https://www.opensourcedesign.net">Open Source Design</a>, a volunteer group that advocates the importance of human-centred and participatory design approaches to Free and Open Source Software projects.</p>
           <p>I have extensive experience in:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Planning, executing and analysing qualitative research studies.</li>
             <li>Common quantitative research approaches in the software industry, such as surveys and analysis of system use data.</li>
             <li>Engaging marginalised groups and people deemed “vulnerable” in research activities,  as demonstrated by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UosJ67QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">my academic, peer reviewed publications</a></li>
             <li>Software requirements gathering, participatory design workshops and expert design evaluations.</li>
             <li>Design for websites, web applications, native applications and operating systems, for desktop, tablet and mobile, and across numerous verticals (retail and investment banking, telecommunications, education, government, enterprise applications, software development tools, open source software, etc.).</li>
             <li>Producing software design speciﬁcations and prototypes with both design (e.g. Figma, Sketch) and web development tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git).</li>
             <li>Implementation work and collaboration with software engineering teams within agile and open source environments.</li>
             <li>Training and <a href="https://speakerinnen.org/en/profiles/belen-barros-pena">public speaking</a> at design and development conferences.</li>

         <h3>Postgraduate Research Fellow - Queen Mary University London</h3>
         <p><strong>From January 2022</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>I am currently a post-doctoral researcher with the <a href="https://autisticadultsonline.com/">Autistic Adults Online project</a>, based at Queen Mary University London. We are exploring how to design more inclusive social media platforms, and how to improve the digital communication experience of autistic adults. In this project, I am responsible for all participatory design activities, which include a set of 12 co-design workshops.</p>

         <h3>Consulting - Service Design, Interaction Design and User Research</h3>
         <p><strong>Since September 2017</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>I have been consulting on design and research since leaving my last full-time position at Intel in October 2016. I have done consulting work for the following companies and projects:</p>
           <h4><a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/">Digital Catapult</a></h4>
           <p>I supported the Digital Catapult on their research eﬀorts with embedded computing engineers as part of the CHERI-Morello project, an open source collaboration between Arm, Cambridge University and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).</p>
           <h4><a href="https://www.redassociates.com/">Red Associates</a></h4>
           <p>I was part of the team undertaking the biggest international, ethnographic study on living with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) carried out to date. I contributed ﬁeld research in Spain.</p>
           <h4><a href="https://taler.net/en/">GNU Taler</a></h4>
           <p>This free software project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a digital currency that preserves and respects citizens’ privacy, while protecting society from money laundering and tax evasion. I supported their design efforts from July to October 2021. Since Taler is a free software project, all design work was done in the open, with all design deliverables available in this Git repository: <a href="https://git.taler.net/large-media.git/">https://git.taler.net/large-media.git/</a></p>
           <h4><a href="https://www.deonticdata.com/">Deontic Data</a></h4>

           <h4><a href="https://authkeys.io/">AuthKeys</a></h4>
           <p>During April and May 2020 I helped this Italian startup to redesign their product website and signup process.</p>
           <h4>UK Department for Education</h4>
           <p>During August and September 2017 I led a research initiative on organisational change. We planned, scheduled, executed and analysed more than 30 interviews to uncover collaboration issues between agile and user-centred digital projects, policy teams and management departments.</p>
           <h4><a href="https://wedigital.garden/en">WeDigitalGarden</a></h4>
           <p>During July and August 2017 I worked as a ﬁeld researcher in an international ethnographic study for a retail software business. I carried out and documented ﬁeld research sessions in the Barcelona area, which involved shadowing sales representatives as they worked in stores, followed by semi-structured interviews.</p>
           <h4>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</h4>
           <p>From February to April 2017 I supported the digital transformation eﬀorts underway at MHRA. As a senior user experience designer, I was responsible for ensuring that all actions were undertaken following user-centred design principles, as per the guidelines established by the Government Digital Service (GDS).

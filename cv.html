         <h2>Professional experience</h2>
         <h3>PhD Candidate - School of Design, Northumbria University</h3>
         <p><strong>From October 2017 to April 2021</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>I am currently in the last stages of my PhD studies on Human Computer Interaction at the School of Design of Northumbria University, where I am supervised by <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/v/john-vines/">Prof. John Vines</a>. I do research on the design of financial technologies in collaboration with groups traditionally excluded from their production process, such as older adults and people living with mental health conditions. </p>
           <p>My research grant comes from the <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/">UK Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> and requires my research to be undertaken in collaboration with industry partners. I have collaborated with the Vulnerable Customers and Innovation teams at Santander UK supporting their qualitative research efforts; as well as <a href="https://usetouco.com/">Touco</a>, a “fintech" startup based in London.</p>

         <h3>User Experience Trainer - UX Design Institute</h3>
         <p><strong>Since September 2017</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>In September 2017 I joined the teaching team at the <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com">UX Design Institute</a>, where I teach 2-day, classroom-based trainings on user experience, as well as mentoring students of their university-certified online courses. </p>
         </div>
         <h3>User Experience Designer - AuthKeys</h3>
         <p><strong>April - May 2020</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>During April and May 2020 I joined <a href="https://authkeys.io/">AuthKeys</a> to help them re-design their product website and their signup process.</p>
           <p>AuthKeys provides SSH authentication as a service, a very technical product targeted to software engineers. The company needed a designer who was able to quickly come up to speed with the nature of the service, and helped them communicate it simply and clearly. With a solid understanding of the fundamentals of computing, and lengthy experience in the design of software engineering tools, I fitted the bill.</p>
           <p>Using a combination of high-fidelity mockups, web-based prototypes and my own contributions through their GitLab infrastructure, we produced, built and rolled out the new design within a month.<p>

         <h3>Senior Design Researcher (contract) - Department for Education</h3>
         <p><strong>August - September 2017</strong></p>
         <div class="lead">
           <p>During my 8 weeks at the Department for Education I led a research initiative on organisational change. We planned, scheduled, executed and analysed more than 30 interviews to uncover collaboration issues between agile and user-centered digital projects, policy teams and management departments.</p>
           <p>Our interviews higlighted the tensions between the agile development processes applied to digital services, and more &quot;traditional&quot; management approaches applied to planning, budgeting and policymaking.</p>
           <p>Recommendations included the introduction of participatory design processes across organisational boundaries, and the identification and planning of participatory design pilot initiatives.</p>
